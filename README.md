lets me rename any window (on windows)

looks like this:
![popup](https://github.com/BradFeng02/Better-Windows/raw/master/BetterWindows(Simple)/screenshots/rename%20popup.png)

i wanted to make it because everytime i got a pdf made from MS word the window title would be "microsoft word-..." which isn't helpful

I want to expand it eventually so i can do things like search for window titles.
