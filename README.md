lets me rename any window. its surprisingly helpful

it started with me wanting to rename chrome windows, since sometimes I have many windows open and the names arent descriptive.
Like sometimes, a pdf in chrome is made from a word doc so the entire window name is just "microsoft word-..." and not the actual name.

Turns out there isn't an extension to rename chrome windows, so I googled it and found that ahk can rename windows. But I didn't want to use ahk so researched some more and wrote this little app

right now, i can rename windows or reset their name, with a cute little popup. I have plans to expand it into a full window manager where I can search for window names, switch to them, rename them, etc. all from one menu. Thats why the current version is called "simple," since I wanted to quickly get a working version to rename windows.

this was pretty fun to make because i never worked with Windows apis before and it helps me learn c++

i'm just dumping projects to github right now
